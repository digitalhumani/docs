  After registration, you will have access to 2 separate environments: Sandbox and Production.

  The Sandbox environment is used primarily for testing and getting familiar with the API. There are no costs associated with planting trees in Sandbox. Once you are ready to plant real trees, you should do so in the Production environment. 

  You can access the Sandbox dashboard by logging in at [https://my.sandbox.digitalhumani.com](https://my.sandbox.digitalhumani.com). Initially, you will have the same login credentials for both Production and Sandbox.

  Note that you will have a separate API key in the Sandbox and Production environments. To access your API key, navigate to the *Developer* page.
