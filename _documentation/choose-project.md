  One of the most important first steps of planting trees is deciding where to plant them! We can help you with that process. !ORG_NAME! supports many great reforestation organizations around the world, so you can plant trees virtually anywhere. 
  
  A full list of projects you can support is available via the API - see the [`GET /project`](/#apiprojects_list)  request below.

  Not sure where to start? We have a few suggestions:
  - Shoot us [an email](mailto:info@!SUPPORT_EMAIL!). We're happy to discuss your options in more detail.
  - We've created a special project that plants trees *where they're needed most*. This will either defer the decision on where the trees are planted, or can be a temporary placeholder that can be updated to a different project later on. The ID for this project is *14442771*.
