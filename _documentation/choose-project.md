  One of the most important first steps of planting trees is deciding where to plant them! We can help you with that process. DigitalHumani supports many great reforestation organizations around the world, so you can plant trees virtually anywhere. 
  
  A full list of projects you can support is available via the API - see the [`GET /project`](/#apiprojects_list)  request below.

  Not sure where to start? We have a few suggestions:
  - Shoot us [an email](mailto:info@digitalhumani.com). We're happy to talk thru the process with you
  - We've created a special project that plants trees *where they're needed most*. This will either defer the decision on where the trees are planted, or can be a temporary placeholder that can be updated to a different project later on. The ID for this project is *14442771*.
