  Welcome to the documentation for the [DigitalHumani](https://digitalhumani.com) API! We refer to this service as **RaaS**, or "Reforestation as as Service". It is a simple API for planting trees with trusted reforestation organizations.

  This a *REST* API. All requests should be made over SSL, and all response bodies, including errors, are encoded in *JSON*. We likewise recommend that all requests be JSON encoded and include the `Content-Type: “application/json”` request header.

  This documenation will include some high-level information on topics such as authentication and billing followed by detailed information on available API routes. 

  Got any questions, or looking something that's not specified in the docs? Feel free to shoot us a question at [info@digitalhumani.com](mailto:info@digitalhumani.com). We're here to help!
