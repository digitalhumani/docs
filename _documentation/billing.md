  The **RaaS** solution is 100% free. You only pay for the trees at a cost of **$1 per tree**, and payment is made directly to the reforestation organization. By paying the reforestation organization directly, you can be sure that every cent is spent on planting trees.

  Here's what you can expect from the billing process:
  1. At the beginning of each month, we’ll check-in with you via a quick email to confirm the tree planting requests you’ve made in the last month.
  2. If all looks ok, we’ll then reach out to our partner reforestation organization where you requested to plant trees and have them initiate an invoice. 
  3. You’ll receive an invoice from the reforestation organization and be able to remit payment directly to them. 
  4. Once you pay the reforestation organization, they begin the process of planting these trees. 

  Note: Some reforestation organizations request a minimum number of tree planting requests before providing an invoice, normally around 20 trees. If you do not end up planting 20 trees within a month, we normally just extend the billing period until you do hit the minimum. 
  
  This is a flexible process, and we're happy to help you through it - [reach out to us](mailto:!SUPPORT_EMAIL!) with any questions you have.
